# README - Rails Goal Tracker

Welcome to 'GOAL CHEER," a community goal tracking application, built using Rails 5.2.2. Upon install, you will have access to an application that allows users to uniquely log in (can also log in through Facebook) and see all user goals, where a user can then 'cheer' on another user or comment on their goal.
In addition, a user can create their own goals and log all kinds of goal attributes. They can then sort their goals or all user goals by different parameters. A user's goal can be edited, updated & deleted. All goals are public for the purpose of accountability and cheering others on! Enjoy!

## Installation

Clone this repo and run

```bundle install```


Then migrate the databases by running

```db:migrate```


To see the application in your browser, run

```rails s```


and then go to

http://localhost:3000

Create an account to start goal setting or cheering on others!
